        "node_text": "Alopecia areata can't be cured. But it can be treated and hair can grow back. If you have it, there are several things to try:\nCorticosteroids. These are anti-inflammatory drugs that are prescribed for autoimmune diseases. They can be given as an injection into the scalp or other areas. They can also be given as a pill or rubbed on the skin as an ointment, cream, or foam. The downside is that it may take a long time to work. \n Topical immunotherapy. This is used when there's a lot of hair loss or if it happens more than once. Chemicals are applied to the scalp to produce an allergic reaction. If it works, this reaction is actually what makes the hair grow back. It also causes an itchy rash and usually has to be repeated several times to keep the new hair growth. \nMinoxidil (Rogaine). This treatment, which is put on the scalp, is already used for pattern baldness. It usually takes about 12 weeks before you see growth, and some users are disappointed in the results. Read more about which types of alopecia are most likely to respond to minoxidil. \n Other treatments for alopecia areata include medications that are sometimes used for other autoimmune disorders. These medicines have differing amounts of success in regrowing hair.",

Doctors aren't sure exactly what causes CFS, but they think it might be a virus or inflammation. CFS happens most often in women between the ages of 30 and 50. People who have CFS have extreme exhaustion and can also have trouble concentrating, nonrestful sleep, a sore throat, joint pain without swelling or redness, muscle aches, enlarged lymph nodes, extreme tiredness after exercise, and headaches.
