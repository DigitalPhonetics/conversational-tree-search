        "node_text": "You might have appendicitis. \n Appendicitis is a serious infection of the appendix, a small fingerlike tube located where the large and small intestine join. About half of people who have appendicitis feel abdominal pain that begins near the belly button and moves to the lower right. If not treated rapidly, the appendix will likely burst, spreading infection throughout the abdomen, a dangerous condition known as peritonitis. Surgery to remove the appendix, called an appendectomy, can prevent this. People 10 years old to 30 years old are most likely to have appendicitis.",

        "node_text": "If you have sepsis, your doctor will probably keep you in the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU). Your medical team will try to stop the infection, keep your organs working, and manage your blood pressure. IV fluids and extra oxygen can help with this. \n Broad-spectrum antibiotics may fight infections caused by bacteria early on. Once your doctor knows what's causing your sepsis, they can give you medicine that targets that specific germ. Often, doctors prescribe vasopressors (which make your blood vessels narrow) to improve blood pressure. You could also get corticosteroids to fight inflammation or insulin to keep control of your blood sugar. \n If your case is severe, you might need other types of treatment, like a breathing machine or kidney dialysis. Or you may need surgery to drain or clean out an infection.",
